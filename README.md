Portable office actually means the works done on the cellphone and the tablet and we need input system to saving our time on typing on them. So a smart and efficient keyboard is required and the core of this input system is a predictive text model. The objective of this report is to analyze the data for the Capstone Project. Therefore I analyzed the 3 data sets "twitter", "blogs" and "news". I will show that each data set have a different usage of language.

## Data Collection

The data were downloaded from the course website (from [HC Corpora](www.corpora.heliohost.org)) and unzipped to extract the English database as a corpus. Three text documents from the twitter, blog and news were found with each line standing for a message.
